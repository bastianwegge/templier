# Templi√©r

Templi√©r is a Go web frontend development environment for
[Templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ)

- Watches your `.templ` files and rebuilds them.
- Watches all non-template files, rebuilds and restarts the server.
- Automatically reload your browser tabs when the server restarts.
- Runs [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) if enabled.
- Reports all errors directly to all open browser tabs.
- Shuts your server down gracefully.
- Displays application server console logs in the terminal.

## How it works

Templi√©r acts as a file watcher, proxy server and process manager.
Once Templi√©r is started, it begins watching files in the `app.dir-src-root` directory.
On start and on file change, it automatically builds your application server executable
assuming that the main package is specified by the `app.dir-cmd` directory. Any custom
Go compiler CLI arguments can be specified by `app.go-flags`. Once built,
the application server executable is launched with `app.flags` CLI parameters and
the working directory set to `app.dir-work`. When necessary, the application server
process is shut down gracefully, rebuilt, linted and restarted.

Templi√©r hosts your application under the URL specified by `templier-host` and proxies
all requests to the application server process that it launched injecting Templi√©r
JavaScript that opens a websocket connection to Templi√©r from the browser tab to listen
for events and reload or display necessary status information when necessary.
In the CLI console logs, all Templi√©r logs are prefixed with ü§ñ,
while application server logs are displayed without the prefix.
